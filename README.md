# Handwritten Digit Classification

The project is to develop a deep learning nueral network for the prediction of the digit it uses python , 
tensorflow , keras , jupyternotebook,numpy,tkinter.
In this project MNIST dataset in loaded and convert it into a vector form which is provided as input and
consist of hidden layer to improve the accuracy.

A GUI is also developed to allow user to draw the digit and uses the model to predict the digit 
along with the accuracy of that prediction.
